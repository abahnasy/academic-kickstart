My name is Ahmed Bahnasy. I’m currently pursuing my masters degree in Machine Learning and Data Anaytics at The Technical University in Munich, Germany. I’m working also as part-time Data Scientist at Allianz SE. I’ve graduated from The German University in Cairo in 2016, with a bachelor of Science in Mechatronics Engineering. after graduation, I’ve joined an engineering services and consultancy company working in industerial automation for 7 months and then moved to Valeo, a multinational automotive tier-1 supplier as an embedded software engineer. in Spetember 2019, I resigned and left for Munich to pursue my masters.

I’ve great passion for oceans and marine life, that’s why I take diving as hobby, I’m an advanced open water certified diver from PADI and Im planning to enter the technical diving world to push the boundaries of my exploration in the marine life.

I spend most of my free time running, hiking when possible, improving my photography skills or reading about marine life, oceans, technical diving and diving theory.
